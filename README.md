A series of minimalistic role-playing minigames made using **Python 3** and **[John Zelle's graphics.py](https://mcsp.wartburg.edu/zelle/python/graphics.py)**, developed over my college years of 2016-2018.

I figured I'd upload them all here for posterity. Alongside the .py files, you'll find an application called **rpg3plus.exe**. It's an improved, portable version of RPGIII called **RPGIII+**, but its source code may have died on my old laptop. Oops!
